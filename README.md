## Accuracy Table

|   Algorithm   |  Score    |
|---------------|-----------|
|     SVC       |  98.67    |
|     KNN       |  98.67    |
|    XGBoost    |  100.00   |

**Note**: All above models are tested on trainning data, In XGB here it may be case of `over-fitting` Because models almost never be 100% accurate.
